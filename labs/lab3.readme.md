# One Day Fullstack Workshop -- Demo Block 3

This project state is prepared for you to check out the details of the previous presentation block.

## Instructions

The `block3` project combines the backend parts from block 1 with the frontend from block 2, introducing the glue elements you have seen in the live demonstration. Please spend time exploring the `block3` state and its new elements. You can either pick one of the two frontend projects, based on your own preferences, or look at both for comparison.

You can start the project using this command:

```shell
npm run start:block3
```

### Practice Task

Both the React and the Svelte projects are missing a small piece of code that enables the Orders view to work correctly -- in the `block3` state, which is also the starting point of the lab 3 practice task, the "working" spinner is displayed when you navigate to the Orders view.

Your job is to find the commented location where the relevant code is missing, and add it. The comment in that location gives you an additional hint.

You can run the starting point of lab 3 using this command:

```shell
npm run start:lab3:start
```
